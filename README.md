# Learn About Arrays, Loops, and Functions

In this presentation, attendees will gain a better understanding of JavaScript arrays, loops, and functions.

## Section JavaScript Code
- [Arrays](./class-4-arrays.js)

Sample code for arrays:
```js
let movies = [
    "Star Wars", 
    "Twilight", 
    "Harry Potter", 
    "Hunger Games", 
    "Black Panther"
];

movies.push("Mean Girls");
```
- [Loops](./class-4-loops.js)

Sample code for loops:
```js
for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    console.log(`${i} Kitty: =^.^=`);
}
```

- [Functions](./class-4-functions.js)

Sample code for functions:
```js
let ourFirstFunction = function(){
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
// Call the function
ourFirstFunction();
```
